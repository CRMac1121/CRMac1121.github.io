I aslo love to watch hockey.  I started watching hockey at a young age and have always loved the game.
The speed and physicality of the sport is what made me fall in love with it.
My favorite team has to be the Boston Bruins since they're my home team.  
I started playing hockey when I was in the 6th grade and it was by far the most fun sport I've ever played.
Although I liked hockey I stopped playing sophomore year so that I could run indoor track instead. 
I miss playing hockey a lot but I stil enjoy playing pond hockey with my friends during the winter.
