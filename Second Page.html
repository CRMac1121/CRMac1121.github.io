	<p>
	Woburn is a city about 15 minutes outside of Boston with a population around 40,000.  We call ourselves the "Tanners" due to all the tanneries that we used to have.  I've lived in Woburn my whole life with my parents, two sisters, and my brother.  My mom and dad aslo lived in Woburn, which makes me a third generation Tanner.  Woburn is a great city and I love to call it my home.  In Woburn we like to call this "Tanner pride".
