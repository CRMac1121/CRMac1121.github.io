    I started watching soccer when I was 13.  
	Manchester United became my favorite team because my dad loved their star player Wayne Rooney.
	When I first started watching them they weren't doing too great, but they continued to get better and show signs of the classic Manchester United.
	This year they're doing fantastic sitting in second place in the Premier League having 6 wins 1 tie, and only 2 goals against (as of October 12).
	I played soccer from the age of 8 to 18.  I played for Woburn travel teams and for the Woburn high school team.
